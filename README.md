# Hand Gestures Recognition and Automation (Perceptron and CNN)

The primary objective is to identify hand gestures. We trained the model using our proprietary dataset, initially employing the Perceptron algorithm and later transitioning to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The dataset is included in the repository. Currently, the model is configured to distinguish seven specific gestures, but it can readily be adapted to recognize a broader range of hand gestures. Additionally, we have shared the code responsible for capturing and processing hand images used in the training process.
Model gives a high train accuracy: *99.95%* and validation accuracy: *98.81%*
